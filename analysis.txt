We have decided to use Node as our back-end architecture for our solution. This is primarily due to the fact that JavaScript is the only language which all members of our group are comfortable with. In addition, Node is a relatively user-friendly architecture which should limit complications due to complexity later in the project. Node also should be able to fulfill all of the requirements our software will demand. It also is the only back-end architecture covered in great detail in class, which makes finding resources and answers pertaining to it much easier.

We briefly discussed using PHP for our backend, but ultimately decided to go with Node.js. Compared to Node, PHP appears to have a much higher learning curve than Node.js. Since we are making small, relatively lightweight requests, PHP seemed to be a bit excessive for our needs. Our app is going to be relatively lightweight and focus on doing a handful of features really well, so we don't need to introduce the complex structure that PHP provides. In addition, PHP's URL routing is also a bit complex and requires a lot of homemade solutions, whereas Node provides this right out of the box.
