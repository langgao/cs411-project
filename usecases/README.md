# Use Cases

## Select an Action
Users will be presented with a set of "actions" they want to complete. These actions could be things like "sleep", "exercise", or "party". The user can choose at most one action (i.e. Users cannot mix actions together). If the user does not select "Party", the app will generate a playlist of your own music given constraints set by the action. For example, a constraint for the "Sleep" action could be that the music must be within a low decibel range.

## Enable Discover Mode
If the user enables "Discover" mode, any playlists generated will be music related to the user's most listened to genres, but may not necessarily contains songs from a user's library. This applies for every action except for when the user selects the "Party" action.

## Select "Party" Action
If the user selects the "Party" action, the user will be presented with a list of Facebook friends who have Spotify accounts linked. The user will be able to create a list based on some or all of these friends. The app will then generate a shareable playlist based upon music that the user and their friends are interested in. The user will then be able to distribute a link that friends can use to view the track listings.

## Login to App
Upon launching application the user will be taken to the login page.The user will be given the option of logging in with either their Facebook or Spotify account. Facebook / Spotify will take care of user authentication, and when the user successfully logs in they will be directed back to the app homepage. If it is the user's first time using the app the user will be prompted to link their Facebook / Spotify so the app knows which accounts to look at for social interactions.
